        So this is the Anti-recoil section. The code is simple and self contained.

        To anyone who is trying to make this any more efficient might see that we have gotton some of these values
        before, but I also had this idea but its not worth it. The pitch and yaw change every so slightly at these 
        milisecond times and can cause your pitch and yaw to shake and other unwanted behavior. Just get them again.

        Next is the aimbot. For the sake of keeping the code relitivly clean, I am a going to write out the explenation here.
        The first thing we do is setup a "timesLooped" this acts as an index for our entityies similer to how "i" is used in for loops
        We also have a "LockedEntity" witch is the index of the player we are locked onto, as you can see if no key is down we reset the lock as that means the player let go and the lock should be reset
        Then we have some conditions in our while loop, that the LockedEntity is 71 (a locked entity of 71 means that no entity should be targeted) that some key aimbot key is down and that variable loop is true
        The first thing inside the loop is a if statment breaking the loop if we are above 70 entitys (no players exist over 70 entitys)
        Then we look at weather we have toggled on a sort method of distance of FOV (for close range aimbot we auto use close range as its wayyy better (trust))
        Depending on the method we find the distance/FOV of the current entity and match it with the unsorted list to get the original entity index
        If we reach a point were the entity we are on has a value of 654321 (the designated value we established was for entities that did not exist) we set loop to false witch will soon break the loop
        If the loop is false (it could be like that from the for loops described above) we exit the loop
        We use the LocalPlayer to get new positions for us
        we get the BasePointer again and the position of the current entity were on
        we then determin were we would need to look to look at the player
        we do some math to figure our how much we would need to move the camara to achive looking at the player
        we get the team of the player
        then based on what key we are pressing and what settings we have configured we decide weather or not to lock onto the entity or skip it
